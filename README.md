# Project 2: Continuous Control

## Project Details

In this project, I trained a DDPG agent to perform continuous control of a robotic arm in the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of the agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

### Solving the Environment

The agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents).  Specifically,
- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent.  This yields 20 (potentially different) scores.  We then take the average of these 20 scores. 
- This yields an **average score** for each episode (where the average is over all 20 agents).

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those average scores is at least +30. 

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

This project is from the Udacity DRLND repository and requires all of the dependencies listed at https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies are satisfied in order to execute the code.

### Download the Unity Environment

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

2. Place the file in this GitHub repository, in the root of the folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

## Instructions

The entry point for this application is the Jupyter Notebook `Continuous_Control.ipynb`.
 1. Launch a jupyter notebook service in `drlnd-project-2` and open `Continuous_Control.ipynb`.
 2. Edit cell #2 (`env = UnityEnvironment(file_name='Reacher_Linux/Reacher.x86_64')`) based on the instructions above it to match your version of the Unity Environment.
 3. To execute all of the code and train a new agent, click `Cell` --> `Run All`.
 4. To view the pre-trained agent, execute all of the cells except cell 11, which starts with `scores = []`.
